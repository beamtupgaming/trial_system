# Lawyer Roleplay Trial System

This FiveM resource provides a basic trial system for lawyer roleplay scenarios. Players can initiate trials, submit verdicts, and participate in the trial process as judges, lawyers, or accused individuals.

## Features

- **Trial Initiation**: Players can request trials, with judges, defense lawyers, and accused participants.
- **Verdict Submission**: Judges can submit verdicts for the trial, determining whether the accused is guilty or not guilty.
- **Basic Trial UI**: Includes a simple trial UI to submit verdicts.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Place the `trial_system` directory in the `resources` folder of your FiveM server.
3. Add `start trial_system` to your server configuration file (`server.cfg`) to start the resource.

## Usage

1. In-game, players can use the command `/starttrial [defense] [accused]` to initiate a trial. Replace `[defense]` and `[accused]` with the names of the defense lawyer and the accused player.
2. Judges can submit verdicts through the trial UI.
3. The trial UI will display information about the trial and allow the judge to select a verdict.
